# Album du Jour Enhancement Project - Planning Summary

## Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive planning summary for the Album du Jour website enhancement project based on the requirements provided in `for-manus.md`.

## What Was Analyzed

### Current System
- **Website**: https://albumdujour.lufs.audio - Static site with basic black background
- **Data Source**: Google Sheets "2025-media" with music library data
- **Current Sections**: Currently Listening, Up Next, Recently Finished
- **Technology**: Python build script + Bash deployment script
- **Issues Identified**: 
  - Bland visual design
  - Build process problems with Git branches
  - Missing timestamp-based sorting
  - No mobile optimization
  - Missing brand elements

### Requirements Gathered
- **Visual**: Dynamic background, LUFS brand colors, responsive design
- **Content**: Change "Up Next" to "Recently Added", add collapsible sections
- **Logic**: Use timestamps for sorting, limit to 20 albums per section
- **Build**: Fix Git workflow, secure credential handling
- **Assets**: Create favicon, improve documentation

### Brand Research
- **LUFS Colors**: Teal (#78BEBA), Red (#D35233), Yellow (#E7B225), Blue (#2069af), Black (#111111), White (#fbf9e2)
- **Design Language**: Skeumorphic, minimal, gradient borders (inspired by echobridge.lufs.audio)
- **Animation**: Floating/waving background elements (inspired by lufs.audio)

## Deliverables Created

### 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**File**: `PRD_Album_du_Jour.md`
- Complete functional and non-functional requirements
- Success metrics and constraints
- Timeline and milestones
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### 2. Technical Design Document (TDD)
**File**: `TDD_Album_du_Jour.md`
- Detailed technical architecture
- Code specifications and examples
- Database and API integration details
- Security implementation
- Performance optimization strategies

### 3. Implementation Plan
**File**: `Implementation_Plan.md`
- 7-phase implementation roadmap
- Detailed task breakdown with time estimates
- Dependencies and resource requirements
- Risk management and contingency plans
- Success criteria and delivery specifications

## Key Technical Solutions Designed

### Backend Enhancements
```python
# New timestamp parsing logic
def parse_timestamp(timestamp_str):
    if not timestamp_str or 'XX' in timestamp_str:
        return None
    return datetime.fromisoformat(timestamp_str.replace('Z', '+00:00'))

# Album categorization with proper sorting
def categorize_albums(records):
    # Sort by Date Added and Date Finished timestamps
    # Limit to 20 albums per section
    # Filter out placeholder entries
```

### Frontend Redesign
- **Animated Background**: Floating gradients with LUFS colors
- **Collapsible Sections**: JavaScript-powered with localStorage persistence
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with touch optimization
- **Brand Integration**: Gradient borders, custom favicon, consistent typography

### Build Process Fixes
```bash
# Clean orphan branch creation
git checkout --orphan build
git rm -rf .
# Whitelist-only file copying for security
# Comprehensive credential protection
```

### Visual Assets
- **Favicon**: SVG vinyl record design with LUFS colors
- **Background**: Animated floating elements
- **UI Elements**: Gradient borders, hover effects, micro-interactions

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| 1. Analysis & Planning | 1 day | âœ… PRD, TDD, Implementation Plan |
| 2. Design & Assets | 2-3 days | Favicon, visual assets, design system |
| 3. Backend Enhancement | 2-3 days | Enhanced Python script, data logic |
| 4. Frontend Redesign | 3-4 days | HTML/CSS/JS, responsive design |
| 5. Build Process | 2-3 days | Fixed Git workflow, security |
| 6. Documentation | 1-2 days | README files, user guides |
| 7. Testing & Delivery | 2-3 days | Cross-device testing, final package |

**Total Estimated Duration**: 13-20 days

## Key Features to be Implemented

### Content Organization
- **Currently Listening**: Single album, prominently displayed (album du jour)
- **Recently Added**: Last 20 albums, collapsible section
- **Recently Finished**: Last 20 albums, collapsible section
- **Google Sheets Link**: Stylized link at bottom of page

### Visual Enhancements
- **Dynamic Background**: Animated floating elements with LUFS brand colors
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for smartphone, tablet, desktop
- **Brand Consistency**: LUFS color palette throughout
- **Custom Favicon**: Skeumorphic vinyl record design

### Technical Improvements
- **Timestamp Processing**: Parse Date Added/Date Finished from CSV
- **Data Filtering**: Ignore blank rows and placeholder timestamps
- **Build Security**: Credentials never committed to Git
- **Git Workflow**: Proper main/build branch separation

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **API Changes**: Fallback to CSV processing
- **Build Failures**: Comprehensive error handling and rollback
- **Performance Issues**: Lazy loading and optimization

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to PRD requirements
- **Technical Complexity**: Phase-based delivery with core features first

## Success Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] All PRD requirements implemented
- [ ] Build process creates proper Git branches
- [ ] Cross-device compatibility verified
- [ ] Music embeds work properly

### Performance
- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Responsive design score > 95%
- [ ] Accessibility score > 90%

### Security
- [ ] No credentials in build branch
- [ ] Security verification passes
- [ ] Proper .gitignore configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Review Planning Documents**
   - Approve PRD, TDD, and Implementation Plan
   - Confirm scope and timeline
   - Provide feedback or changes needed

2. **Begin Implementation**
   - Start with Phase 2: Design Research and Asset Creation
   - Set up development environment
   - Begin favicon design and visual asset creation

3. **Regular Progress Updates**
   - Daily progress reports
   - Weekly milestone reviews
   - Issue escalation as needed

## Questions for Clarification

Before proceeding with implementation, please confirm:

1. **Scope Approval**: Are all requirements in the PRD accurate and complete?
2. **Timeline**: Is the 13-20 day timeline acceptable?
3. **Priorities**: Are there any features that should be prioritized or deprioritized?
4. **Technical Constraints**: Any additional constraints or requirements not covered?
5. **Review Process**: How would you like to review progress and provide feedback?
