# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Album du Jour Website Enhancement

### Executive Summary

The Album du Jour website is a static site generator that showcases music albums from a personal listening library. This enhancement project aims to improve the visual design, content organization, and build process while maintaining the core functionality of displaying album information with embedded music players.

### Project Overview

**Project Name:** Album du Jour Website Enhancement  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** June 23, 2025  
**Owner:** Daniel Ramirez / LUFS Audio  

### Current State Analysis

The existing website (https://albumdujour.lufs.audio) features:
- Static site generation from Google Sheets data
- Three sections: Currently Listening, Up Next, Recently Finished
- Embedded Apple Music and Spotify players
- Basic black background with minimal styling
- Build process with Git deployment to separate branches

### Problem Statement

1. **Visual Design**: The current black background is bland and doesn't align with the LUFS brand aesthetic
2. **Content Organization**: Sections need better hierarchy and user interaction (collapsible sections)
3. **Data Logic**: Timestamp-based sorting is not implemented for Recently Added/Recently Finished sections
4. **Build Process**: The current build script has issues creating proper build branches
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Design needs optimization across all device types
6. **Branding**: Missing favicon and cohesive brand elements

### Goals and Objectives

#### Primary Goals
1. Enhance visual design with LUFS brand aesthetic and dynamic background elements
2. Improve content organization with collapsible sections and proper data sorting
3. Fix and optimize the build/deployment process
4. Ensure responsive design across all devices
5. Create comprehensive documentation

#### Secondary Goals
1. Maintain existing functionality of music player embeds
2. Preserve Apple Music and Spotify integration
3. Keep the focus on album artwork and music discovery
4. Implement proper SEO and accessibility features

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: Daniel Ramirez (site owner) for personal music library showcase
- **Secondary**: Visitors interested in music discovery and album recommendations
- **Tertiary**: Music enthusiasts and potential collaborators

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Content Organization

#### 2. Data Processing
- Parse CSV timestamps in format: `20XX-XX-XXTXX:XX:XXZ`
- Ignore blank rows and placeholder timestamps
- Sort albums by Date Added and Date Finished timestamps
- Filter out incomplete entries

#### 3. User Interface
- Collapsible sections for Recently Added and Recently Finished
- Currently Listening always visible and centered
- Responsive design for smartphone, tablet, and desktop
- Link to Google Sheets at bottom of page

#### 4. Music Integration

- Preserve existing link styling (can be restyled for design cohesion)
- Ensure embeds work across all devices

#### 5. Build Process
- Generate build folder with static files
- Create separate Git branches (main for source, build for deployment)
- Maintain credential security (never commit sensitive files)
- Automated timestamped commits
- Generate README files for both source and build
