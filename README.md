## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git with push access to your repository
- Google Sheets API credentials at alternative path
- Apple Music and/or Spotify links in your music library

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd albumdujour
   ```

2. **Set up credentials at alternative paths**
   ```bash
   # Ensure your credentials are at these external paths:
   # /Users/danielramirez/Nextcloud/ore/Notes/Life/concrete-spider-446700-f9-4646496845d1.json
   # /Users/danielramirez/Nextcloud/ore/Notes/Life/utilities/musickit (optional)
   ```

3. **Complete build and deployment**
   ```bash
   ./master-build.sh
   ```

## 🛠️ Build Process v3

### Master Pipeline (Recommended)
```bash
./master-build.sh
```
- Runs complete build and deployment process
- Creates website and deploys to Git in one command
- Safe to run repeatedly

### Individual Steps (For Development)

#### Step 1: Build Website
```bash
./build.sh
```
- Creates Python virtual environment
- Fetches data from Google Sheets using external credentials
- Generates enhanced website with simplified design
- Creates build/ directory with all website files
- No Git operations performed

#### Step 2: Deploy to Git
```bash
./deploy.sh
```
- Commits source changes to main branch
- Uses git subtree split to create build branch safely
- Pushes both branches to remote repository
- No risk of deleting repository

### Benefits of v3 Architecture
- **Safe Deployment**: Uses git subtree split (no repo deletion risk)
- **Master Pipeline**: Single command for complete automation
- **Modular Development**: Individual scripts for testing and development
- **Enhanced Security**: External credentials with comprehensive verification
- **Repeatable Process**: Safe to run multiple times

## 📊 Data Format

Your Google Sheets spreadsheet should have the following columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Music | Album - Artist format | `The Don – Donny Benét` |
| Apple Music Link | Full Apple Music URL | `https://music.apple.com/us/album/...` |
| Spotify Link | Full Spotify URL | `https://open.spotify.com/album/...` |
| Status | Current/Open/Done | `Current` |
| Date Added | ISO 8601 timestamp | `2025-01-15T10:30:00Z` |
| Date Finished | ISO 8601 timestamp | `2025-01-20T15:45:00Z` |
| 🌞 | Rating (optional) | `⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐` |

### Credential Security v3
- **External Paths Only**: Credentials never stored in repository
- **Alternative Locations**: Supports external credential storage
- **Build Verification**: Automated security scanning prevents leaks
- **Gitignore Protection**: Comprehensive patterns for sensitive files
- **Safe Deployment**: Git subtree split prevents credential exposure

## 🎨 Design System v3

### LUFS Brand Colors
```css
:root {
    --lufs-teal: #78BEBA;
    --lufs-red: #D35233;
    --lufs-yellow: #E7B225;
    --lufs-blue: #2069af;
    --lufs-black: #111111;
    --lufs-white: #fbf9e2;
}
```

### Minimal Design Philosophy
- **Abstract Favicon**: Simple vinyl record inspired by LUFS brand sites
- **Clean Album Cards**: Minimal design that doesn't compete with embeds
- **Spotify Color Integration**: Let music embeds provide natural color accents
- **Subtle Background**: Gentle floating animation using brand colors

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: < 768px (single column, touch-optimized)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (two columns, hybrid interactions)
- **Desktop**: > 1024px (multi-column, hover effects)

### Performance v3
- **Mobile-First**: CSS written for mobile, enhanced for desktop
- **Lazy Loading**: Embeds load only when visible
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user preferences for animations
- **External Credentials**: No credential processing during build
- **Safe Git Operations**: Subtree split prevents repository issues

git branch -a
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting v3

### Common Issues

#### Master Build Fails
```bash
# Check script permissions
ls -la *.sh

# Run individual steps for debugging
./build.sh
./deploy.sh
```

#### Build Fails with Credentials Error
```bash
# Check external credential paths
ls -la "/Users/danielramirez/Nextcloud/ore/Notes/Life/concrete-spider-446700-f9-4646496845d1.json"

# Verify Google Sheets access
python3 -c "
import gspread
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

# Copy credentials temporarily
alt_path = Path('/Users/danielramirez/Nextcloud/ore/Notes/Life/concrete-spider-446700-f9-4646496845d1.json')
temp_path = Path('temp_test_creds.json')
shutil.copy2(alt_path, temp_path)

# Test connection
gc = gspread.service_account('temp_test_creds.json')
print('✅ Credentials valid')

# Clean up
temp_path.unlink()
"
```

#### Git Deployment Fails
```bash
# Check Git configuration
git remote -v
git status

# Verify build directory exists
ls -la build/

# Test subtree split manually
git subtree split --prefix build -b test-build
git branch -D test-build
```

### Script Options
```bash
# Master pipeline options
./master-build.sh --help
./master-build.sh --build-only

# Individual scripts
./build.sh    # Build only
./deploy.sh   # Deploy only (requires existing build)
```
