## 🚀 Quick Start v3

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Extract the package
unzip albumdujour_manus_v3.zip
cd albumdujour_manus_v3

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x master-build.sh build.sh deploy.sh

# Ensure your credentials are at external paths:
# /Users/danielramirez/Nextcloud/ore/Notes/Life/concrete-spider-446700-f9-4646496845d1.json
# /Users/danielramirez/Nextcloud/ore/Notes/Life/utilities/musickit (optional)
```

### 2. Complete Build and Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the master pipeline (build + deploy)
./master-build.sh
```

This will:
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Fetch data from your Google Sheets using external credentials
- Generate the enhanced website with simplified design
- Commit source changes to main branch
- Use git subtree split to safely create build branch
- Push both branches to remote repository

### 3. Alternative: Individual Steps
```bash
# Step 1: Build website only
./build.sh

# Step 2: Preview locally
open build/index.html

# Step 3: Deploy to Git (when ready)
./deploy.sh
```

## ✨ What's New in v3

### 🔧 Fixed Git Deployment
- **Safe Subtree Split**: Uses `git subtree split --prefix build` (no repo deletion risk)
- **Inspired by Sample Script**: Based on your sync_obsidian-to-hugo.sh workflow
- **Repeatable Process**: Safe to run multiple times without issues
- **Proper Branch Management**: Creates build branch with only website files

### 🎨 Minimal Abstract Favicon
- **Inspired by LUFS Sites**: Checked lufs.audio, echobridge.lufs.audio, danialrami.com
- **Clean Design**: Simple vinyl record without text or excessive detail
- **Brand Colors**: Uses LUFS teal and blue gradient
- **Scalable**: Vector SVG for all screen sizes

### 🚀 Master Build Pipeline
- **Single Command**: `./master-build.sh` runs complete process
- **Build-Only Option**: `./master-build.sh --build-only` for testing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting
- **Help System**: `./master-build.sh --help` for usage information

### 🛡️ Enhanced Security
- **External Credentials**: Uses only alternative credential paths
- **Build Verification**: Automated security scanning before deployment
- **Safe Git Operations**: Subtree split prevents repository corruption
- **Comprehensive Protection**: Multiple layers of credential verification

- `/Users/danielramirez/Nextcloud/ore/Notes/Life/utilities/musickit`

### Google Sheets Setup
Your spreadsheet should have these columns:
- **Music**: Album - Artist format
- **Apple Music Link**: Full Apple Music URL
- **Spotify Link**: Full Spotify URL  
- **Status**: Current/Open/Done
- **Date Added**: ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g., `2025-01-15T10:30:00Z`)
- **Date Finished**: ISO 8601 timestamp
- **🌞**: Rating (optional)

## 🎨 Design System v3

- **Red**: #D35233 (secondary accent)  
- **Yellow**: #E7B225 (highlights)
- **Blue**: #2069af (links and buttons)
- **Black**: #111111 (background)

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Master Pipeline (Recommended)
```bash
# Complete build and deployment
./master-build.sh

# Build only (for testing)
./master-build.sh --build-only

# Help and options
./master-build.sh --help
```

### Individual Scripts
```bash
# Build website
./build.sh

# Deploy to Git (after build)
./deploy.sh
```

### Static Hosting Services
The build branch is ready for deployment:
- **Netlify**: Connect Git repo, deploy from `build` branch
- **Vercel**: Import project, set `build` branch as source
- **GitHub Pages**: Enable Pages, select `build` branch
- **Traditional Hosting**: Download `build` branch files, upload via FTP

## 🧪 Testing v3

### Master Pipeline Testing
```bash
# Test complete pipeline
./master-build.sh --build-only

# Verify build output
ls -la build/
open build/index.html

# Check for credentials (should find none)
grep -r "concrete-spider" build/ || echo "✅ No credentials found"
```

### Git Deployment Testing
```bash
# Test Git status
git status

# Test deployment (after successful build)
./deploy.sh

# Verify build branch
git branch -a
git checkout build
ls -la
git checkout main
```

### Embed Testing
```bash
# Check embed URLs in generated HTML
grep -E "(embed\.music\.apple\.com|open\.spotify\.com/embed)" build/index.html
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting v3

### Master Build Issues
1. **Script permissions**: Run `chmod +x *.sh`
2. **Git repository**: Ensure you're in a Git repo with remote origin
3. **External credentials**: Verify credential paths exist

### Git Deployment Issues
1. **Subtree split fails**: Ensure build directory is committed
2. **Push failures**: Check repository permissions and remote configuration
3. **Branch conflicts**: Use `git status` to check working directory

### Embed Issues
1. **Embeds not loading**: Check Apple Music and Spotify URLs in spreadsheet
2. **Lazy loading**: Embeds load when scrolled into view
3. **Browser testing**: Test in different browsers for compatibility

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Extract Package**: Unzip albumdujour_manus_v3.zip
2. **Review Documentation**: Read README.md for comprehensive setup guide
3. **Set Up External Credentials**: Ensure credentials are at specified paths
4. **Run Master Pipeline**: Execute `./master-build.sh` for complete automation
5. **Verify Deployment**: Check that both main and build branches are pushed
6. **Configure Hosting**: Set up static hosting to serve from build branch
